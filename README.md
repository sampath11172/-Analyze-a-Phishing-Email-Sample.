># ~Look at the domain name carefully
Official PhonePe emails usually come from a domain like @phonepe.com or related subdomain,This email is using the website secure-phonepay.com, but that is not the real official website for PhonePe. 

># ~Check for slight misspellings or extra words
The domain adds the word "secure" and replaces "phonepe" with "phonepay" (PhonePe is the correct brand name).

># ~Check the sender’s email format
Legitimate companies use consistent email formats, often like support@phonepe.com

># ~Hover over the link (do NOT click!)
The URL in the email is www.securephonepay.com, same suspicious domain as the sender, Official PhonePe links usually use their official domain (phonepe.com).

># ~Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body
"⚠ Urgent: Unusual Login Attempt on Your phonepay Account", Use of "Urgent" and a warning emoji ⚠ is meant to create panic and urgency.

># ~conclusion
The email from support@secure-phonepay.com is a fake message trying to trick you into giving away your personal details. It uses scary language like unusual login alerts, account restrictions, and threats of suspension to make you panic. The email address and website link are also fake and try to look like the real PhonePe by slightly changing the spelling.

Don’t click on any links or share your information. Just delete the email and check your account only through the official PhonePe app or website.
